- `outputs/`: Stores processed videos and images.
- `src/`: Source code for the project.
    - `config/`: Configuration settings.
    - `preprocessing/`: Frame extraction and image utilities.
    - `perception/`: Core lane detection algorithms (edge detection, ROI, perspective transform).
    - `geometry/`: Mathematical calculations for lane curvature and steering angles.
    - `visualization/`: Tools for drawing lane overlays.
    - `pipeline/`: Main processing pipeline.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.
